\section{Related Work}
\label{sec: workload-related}

Although edge computing is new, the techniques for reducing offered load to
adapt application behaviors examined in this chapter bear some resemblance to
work that was done in the early days of mobile computing.

Several different approaches to adapting application fidelity have been studied.
Dynamic sampling rate with various heuristics for adaptation have been tried
primarily in the context of individual mobile devices for energy
efficiency~\cite{lorincz2009mercury, lorincz2008resource, vallina2012energy,
lane2010survey}. Semantic deduplication to reduce redundant processing of frames
have been suggested by ~\cite{Hu2015, kang2017noscope, hsieh2018focus,
zhang2015design}. Similarly, previous works have looked at suppression based on
motion either from video content~\cite{naderiparizi2017glimpse,
lebeckcollaborative} or IMUs~\cite{jain2015overlay}. Others have investigated
exploiting multiple deep models with accuracy and resource
tradeoffs~\cite{han2016mcdnn,jiang2018chameleon}. In addition, using tracking as
approximate result of detection and recognition has been explored to leverage
the temporal locality of video data and reduce computational
demand~\cite{wang2017scalable, chen2015glimpse, you1999hybrid}. While most of
these efforts were in mobile-only, cloud-only, or mobile-cloud context, we
explore similar techniques in an edge-native context.


Partitioning workloads between mobile devices and the cloud have been
studied in sensor networks~\cite{newton2009wishbone},
throughput-oriented systems~\cite{cuervo2010maui, yi2017lavea}, for
interactive applications~\cite{ra2011odessa, chen2015glimpse}, and
from programming model perspectives~\cite{balan2003tactics}. We believe
that these approaches will become important techniques to scale
applications on heavily loaded cloudlets.
